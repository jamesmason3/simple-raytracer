A camera sends rays through a screen. Each ray will then return a color based on what it hits.

The colors are affected by the location of a light source and the angles that surfaces are hit by light rays. Anything completely shaded returns (color * ambient light).

A ppm file is created to show the image.
A sample result can be seen in scene.png
